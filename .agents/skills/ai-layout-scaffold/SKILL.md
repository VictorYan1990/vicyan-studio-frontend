  Scaffold a vendor-neutral AI agent config layout in a repository: a canonical
  .agents/ source of truth (AGENTS.md, personas, skills), relative symlinks
  wiring it into .claude/ and .cursor/ so both tools discover skills at session
  start, and CLAUDE.md importing AGENTS.md. Use when the user asks to set up,
  create, bootstrap, or standardize AI agent config / rules / skills / personas
  layout, or wants a "source of truth + link" structure for AI tooling.

# AI Layout Scaffold

Create a **single source of truth** for AI agent config under `.agents/`, then
wire it into the tool-specific directories with relative symlinks. You edit one
place; every agent stays in sync.

## Core principle

- **Canonical (edit here):** `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/personas/`, `.agents/skills/`.
- **Derived (never edit directly):** `CLAUDE.md` (imports `AGENTS.md`), and the
  `.claude/*` / `.cursor/*` symlinks.
- **Links are required, not decorative.** Claude Code's skill scanner is
  hardcoded to `.claude/skills` and has no setting for extra roots, so prose in
  `AGENTS.md` cannot make it find `.agents/skills/`. Cursor *does* scan
  `.agents/skills/` directly, so its links are technically redundant — wire them
  anyway for symmetry, and so the layout does not depend on one vendor's
  current behavior.

See [`ai-config-discovery`](../ai-config-discovery/SKILL.md) for the two-layer
loading model and the evidence behind these claims.

## Idempotency rule (important)

This skill is **non-destructive**. For every file or directory below:

1. If it does **not** exist → create it.
2. If it **already** exists → **skip it** and record it in a "skipped
   (already exists)" list.

After processing everything, if anything was skipped:

- Present the list of existing files that were left untouched.
- **Ask the user** whether to update/overwrite any of them, and wait for
  confirmation before changing existing content. Do not overwrite silently.

## Steps

Run all path checks relative to the repository root.

### 1. Create the canonical `.agents/` tree

```
.agents/
├── personas/     # reusable personas (source of truth)
└── skills/       # reusable Agent Skills (source of truth)
```

- If `.agents/skills/README.md` is missing, create it explaining that this dir
  is canonical and that the tool-specific dirs are symlinks into it.
- Add at least one example persona in `.agents/personas/` only if the directory
  is empty. If personas already exist, leave them.
- Personas double as tool-native subagents through the `agents` links, so give
  each one subagent-compatible frontmatter: kebab-case `name`, a `description`
  that says *when to use it*, and an optional `tools` list.

### 2. Create `AGENTS.md` (instructions source of truth)

If `AGENTS.md` does not exist at the repo root, create it with, at minimum:
- a one-line note that it is the canonical, vendor-neutral source of truth;
- a project overview and key conventions (infer from the repo; keep concise);
- a "Personas" section pointing at `.agents/personas/`;
- an "Agent config layout" section documenting the link model below;
- a short **session-start Layer 1 self-check** block (see step 6). This must
  live in `AGENTS.md`, not in a skill description — if discovery is broken, no
  skill metadata loaded, so only an always-applied rule can catch it.

If it already exists, skip and report it.

### 3. Create `CLAUDE.md` (import, not a copy)

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, create it so Claude Code re-exports the canonical
file instead of duplicating it:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This project keeps its agent guidance in the vendor-neutral `AGENTS.md`:

@AGENTS.md

Do not duplicate guidance here — edit `AGENTS.md` instead.
```

### 4. Wire the tool-specific links

Create four **relative** symlinks:

```
.claude/skills  -> ../.agents/skills
.claude/agents  -> ../.agents/personas
.cursor/skills  -> ../.agents/skills
.cursor/agents  -> ../.agents/personas
```

```bash
ln -s ../.agents/skills   .claude/skills
ln -s ../.agents/personas .claude/agents
ln -s ../.agents/skills   .cursor/skills
ln -s ../.agents/personas .cursor/agents
git config core.symlinks true
```

**Never use a junction (`mklink /J`).** It stores an *absolute* target, so git
commits a machine-specific path instead of `../.agents/skills`, breaking every
other clone. Symlinks are relative and portable.

**On Windows, enable Developer Mode first.** Without it, `ln -s` from WSL on
`/mnt/c` silently creates a WSL-only reparse point that Windows-native tools
cannot traverse (`The file cannot be accessed by the system`) — the classic
"broken junction" symptom. Elevated PowerShell, once per machine:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock' `
  -Name AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense -Value 1
```

Also set `core.symlinks=true` **before** checkout — with `false`, git writes
each link as a plain text file containing the target path.

If a target platform cannot support symlinks at all, fall back to a real copy
plus a sync step — never a junction. Flag the trade-off to the user.

### 5. Update `.gitignore`

Ensure the shared config **is committed** and only personal/secret files are
ignored. Add these entries if absent (do not remove unrelated existing rules):

```gitignore
# AI assistants — commit AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .agents/, and the tool links.
# Ignore only personal/secret files:
.claude/settings.local.json
*.local.json
.cursor/mcp.json           # may hold secrets; template it if you commit one
.ai/                       # scratch prompts / working notes
```

The link paths must **not** be ignored — Claude Code skips skill directories it
detects as gitignored.

### 6. Add the session-start self-check to `AGENTS.md`

A short always-applied block telling agents to verify, **once at the start of a
session and not again**, that the project skills appear in their available-skills
list, and to report a single line either way. This turns a silent Layer 1
failure into a visible one.

### 7. Verify and report

- `ls -la .claude .cursor` — confirm each entry is a symlink (`l` mode bit) with
  a relative target, not a plain file and not a junction.
- Confirm read-through on every platform in use. On Windows:
  `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "Get-ChildItem '<abs>\.claude\skills'"`
- `git check-ignore -v .claude/skills` must find nothing.
- `git ls-files -s .claude .cursor` — each link should show mode `120000`.
- Start a fresh agent session and confirm the skills appear in its
  available-skills list. **This is the only real proof**; a link that exists but
  is not scanned still fails.
- Summarize: what was created, what was skipped, and any open questions.

## Caveats to surface to the user

- **Format drift:** a tool may expect specific frontmatter for its custom
  agents/skills. Adjust per tool if it rejects a shared file — most commonly a
  persona lacking a `tools` field or using a non-kebab-case `name`.
- **Vendor behavior changes:** the scanned paths are implementation details of
  each tool. Re-verify with the self-check after a major tool upgrade rather
  than trusting this document.
